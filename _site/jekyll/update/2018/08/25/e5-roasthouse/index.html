    Welcome to Jekyll!

        <p>E5 Roasthouse is a cafe in Poplar Union art centre which is located in Poplar. Well, the nearest stations from here are Westferry and Mile End which take 15 mins by walk, so people who don’t live in this area might not know this cafe. Even Barry has lived in Poplar over 3 years, he didn’t know this AMAZING cafe…. :D 
This place has so many pros that we love: huge venue, couple of tables outside and green space right in front of it. That’s why we usually spend our whole Sunday morning at the cafe. We used to have iced latte with fresh pizza on the grass, playing Backgammon - staff brings coffee to customers!</p>
